## Introduction
This project is a blog website built using Next.js, a React framework, and GraphCMS, a headless CMS for managing content. The website allows users to view and interact with blog posts seamlessly.

## Client
The client-side of the application is developed with Next.js, leveraging its server-side rendering capabilities for fast and efficient page loads. This part of the project handles the user interface, navigation, and presentation of blog content retrieved from GraphCMS.

## Server
As Next.js handles both client-side and server-side rendering, there's no separate server-side application. However, GraphCMS serves as the backend for managing and delivering content to the client application. It provides an intuitive interface for content creators to write and publish blog posts, which are then consumed by the Next.js frontend.


## Technologies Used

- **NEXT**: For structuring the web page.
- **Cascading Style Sheets**: For styling and animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Using media queries to ensure mobile responsiveness.
- **Optimized Images**: To maintain performance and visual quality.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
